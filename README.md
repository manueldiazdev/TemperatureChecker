# TemperatureChecker
A project that used an Stm32 to take a measure of a thermistor and calculate the temperature around it. Data is then sent to a Raspberry Pi via UART to be able to send a text message to someone if their temperature is higher than 95.5. Pi also displays readings in the console of the script.
